# reddit_clone_code

A full-stack social media application heavily inspired by Reddit, allowing users to post text, photos, and articles, as well as engage in comment threads. This was my first attempt at implementing both the backend and frontend using RESTful APIs and React. As a result, the code is not perfect, but after throwing myself into the deep end, the steep learning curve has solidified my understanding of full-stack development.

This was primarily a lesson in database design by connecting databases and using schemas.

## Features

- User authentication (JWT)

- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) for posts and comments

- Nest comments with replies

- Upvote/Downvote system

- User profiles with avatars

- Sorting posts by date or upvotes

- Material UI design

## Tech stack

**Frontend**:
React.js, Javascript, Material UI, HTML, CSS

**Backend**:
Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

## Data focus

- Entity relationships (users, posts, comments)

- Data normalisation and schema design

- Query optimisation and indexing for sorting and filtering posts

This was a self-driven deep dive into full-stack development. While the codebase has room for improvement, it provided me with a strong foundation in connecting frontend logic with backend APIs and managing structured data across the stack.

This platform could be extended with data dashboards to analyze:

- User engagement trends

- Post popularity over time

- Comment activity
