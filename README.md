# reddit_clone_code

A full-stack social media application heavily inspired by Reddit, allowing users to post text, photos, and articles, as well as engage in comment threads. This was my first attempt at implementing both the backend and frontend using RESTful APIs and React. As a result, the code is not perfect, but after throwing myself into the deep end, the steep learning curve has solidified my understanding of full-stack development.
